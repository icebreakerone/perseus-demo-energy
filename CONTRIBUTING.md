## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[Perseus Demo Energy Code of Conduct](https://github.com/icebreakerone/perseus-demo-energyblob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior
to [perseus@ib1.org](mailto:perseus@ib1.org).

## Asking questions

### Perseus participants

A slack channel is available for participants buidling prototype for the Perseus trust framework pilot, and is the best place to ask questions. If you are not part of the slack channel, please email [perseus@ib1.org](mailto:perseus@ib1.org)

### Other users

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/icebreakerone/perseus-demo-energy/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/icebreakerone/perseus-demo-energy/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the [documentation](https://github.com/icebreakerone/perseus-demo-energy/blob/main/README.md). If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/icebreakerone/perseus-demo-energyissues?q=label%3Abug).
- Collect information about the bug:
- Stack trace (Traceback)
- OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
- Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
- Possibly your input and the output

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> Please do not report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs should be sent by email to perseus@ib1.org

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/icebreakerone/perseus-demo-energy/issues/new). (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the _reproduction steps_ that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed, we will label the issue accordingly and work on it as soon as possible.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Perseus Demo Energy, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**.

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation](https://github.com/icebreakerone/perseus-demo-energy/blob/main/README.md) carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/icebreakerone/perseus-demo-energy/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/icebreakerone/perseus-demo-energy/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why
- Provide links to code, if applicable

### Improving The Documentation

Feedback on our documentation is always welcome. If you see something that is wrong, missing, or could be explained better, you can help us by creating an issue, or by creating a pull request with the suggested changes.

## Commit Messages

Commit messages should start with a short summary line a.k.a. message subject:

Start with an imperative present active verb: Add, Drop, Fix, Refactor, Optimize, etc.

Use up to 50 characters; this is the git official preference.

Finish without a full-stop.

Example: `Add CONTRIBUTING.md`

This summary can be followed by a longer description where more detail is needed. You can add as much information as you want here.
